                                NFL Spread Generator is an application that creates betting spreads
                                based on an algorithm and user-generated data. The purpose of this program
                                is to compare the spreads to the popular Vegas' spreads and look for any
                                discrepancies. If the two disagree on a spread, the objective was for
                                the Spread Generator to be correct. If so, any further discrepancies were
                                betting targets. Additionally, the user is allowed to update team statistics on a weekly
                                basis based on real life score results, which causes the application to 
                                adjust its spreads accordingly.

                                Alfapet Pallet Builder is an application that was created to better organize
                                the layout of pallet orders on the warehouse floor. Since the warehouse has
                                limited space, it is recommended to get the most out of it. There is also
                                additional criteria that a particular pallet order must meet, such as:
                                <br> 
                                <br> &#x2022; A pallet order must not be over 6 layers tall in height
                                <br> &#x2022; A pallet order must not have more than 4 pallets per pallet order
                                <br> &#x2022; A pallet order must be limited to at most one 40 case order per
                                pallet order
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The so-called "laying out" of pallet orders was a laborous task performed by hand but now
                                it is performed by a program that does it in a matter of seconds.
